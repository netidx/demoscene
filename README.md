# Demoscene

Demoscene is an advanced example and proof of concept desktop
application built using netidx. It is a clone of the essential (to me)
features of Rhythmbox.

# State

In it's current form it clones the browse and search modes of
Rhythmbox. There are no explicit playlists, but dynamic ones are
constructed by entering a search filter, and mutli selecting artists
and albums.

Being simply a netidx publisher it is usable from the command line,
and programatically over the network via the netidx api, however it
also includes a default graphical view designed in and for the netidx
browser.

The user can customize this view as desired.

This is an experiment, and a proof of concept. I can't honestly say I
know where it's going to go. Clearly it's possible to build rich
graphical interfaces using netidx. Whether it's desireable or not?
Well, in my humble and biased opinion building this one went pretty
well, but I don't know if that's down to the example I picked.
